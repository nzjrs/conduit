    <title>What is Conduit</title>
    <para>
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www.conduit-project.org">Conduit</ulink> is a synchronization application for GNOME. It allows you to synchronize your files, photos, emails, contacts, notes, calendar data and any other type of personal information and synchronize that data with another computer, an online service, or even another electronic device. Conduit manages the synchronization and conversion of data into other formats. For example, Conduit allows you to; </para>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Conduit's goals are to synchronize your data as seamlessly as possible, be it from from remote device or remote websites. It is about extending your life as you see it needs to be, no longer constrained by data, devices or formats. Conduit enables you to take your data where you want when you want. All of your mobile devices could be synchronized automatically by Conduit. Home file back-ups to a remote server? Synced automatically. </para>
        <para>It may sometimes seem that Conduit is overly complicated, one of the design goals has always been to make the interface as simple and intuitive as possible. However  Conduit is much more powerful then the simplistic design may lead on. This documentation will describe all the configuration options for groups and data providers, while the following gives some examples of items you may wish to synchronize; </para>

If you are required to log into a website, and you have selected the 'use built in web browser' from the Conduit preferences, then a window will pop up like the one shown below. </para>
