	* maintainer.py: Many improvements to NEWS generation
	1) Use template functions like the release notes
	2) Add get_news_items to just get the bits in the NEWS file
	3) When generating a new NEWS file, replace everything up to the last
	revision
	3) Change the update news function to no longer modify the file directly,
	just print the new NEWS to stdout

	* maintainer.py: Add the option to print the NEWS before it is
	written back to the file. s/Manual Translation/Help Manual Translations/
	so that we are consistant everywhere

	* maintainer.py: Convert all remaining spaces to tabs
